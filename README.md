## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

In this challenge, I managed to remember some good CSS styling practices and made the code less verbose by separating parts of the CSS to improve readability. I also merged sections that shared code to avoid unnecessary duplication, and used javascript to make a mobile menu work.

### Continued development

I plan to continue to challenge myself by not only continuing my studies, but also putting all the knowledge I have gained into practice, especially on more complex projects. I might even consider using a CSS superset along the way. I'm also looking forward to improving my Javascript skills.
